# CodeChallenge – Sales Agent for Online Bike Shop

---

## 1. Introduction

The goal of this challenge is to design and implement a **ChatBot API** that acts as a **Sales AI Agent** for an online bike shop.

The Sales Agent should be able to:
- Conduct customer consultations via an API (REST or WebSocket).
- Recommend products from a given product catalog.
- Detect customer interest and guide the conversation.
- Collect customer details (name, email, phone number) when interest is confirmed.
- Create a **Lead** in the internal CRM system.
- Schedule an **Appointment** with a real sales consultant.

This challenge focuses on **automation, data-driven logic, and AI techniques** to simulate a realistic sales workflow.

## 2. Focus of the Assignment

The implementation should emphasize:
- **Automation** – Handle the sales flow with minimal manual intervention.
- **Data** – Use the provided product catalog as the only source for recommendations.
- **AI Best Practices** – Apply techniques like Prompt Engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Vector Search.
- **Scalability** – Package the solution for deployment (e.g., Docker).
- **Flexibility** – Allow the option of using **local LLMs** in addition to APIs like OpenAI.

## 3. Tasks

### Overview

1. **Conversation API**  
   *As a customer, I want to interact with the Sales Agent through an API so that I can receive fluent and natural responses to my questions.*


2. **Product Recommendation**  
   *As a customer, I want the agent to recommend bikes from the catalog based on my preferences (type, price, usage) so that I can find a suitable product.*


3. **Lead Creation**  
   *As a sales organization, I want the agent to collect customer details (name, email, phone number) once interest is confirmed, so that a lead can be created in our CRM system.*


4. **Appointment Scheduling**  (OUT_OF_SCOPE)
   *As a customer, I want the agent to book an appointment with a real sales consultant so that I can discuss my needs in more detail.*


5. **FAQ**  
   *As a customer, I want the agent to also answer general questions (e.g., delivery, warranty, services) from an FAQ knowledge base, so that I get a complete consultation experience.*



### 3.1 Conversation API
- Expose the Sales Agent as an API (REST or WebSocket).
- Accept customer messages and return agent responses.
- Maintain a simple **multi-turn conversation** (context awareness).
-

### 3.2 Product Recommendations
- Use the provided product catalog [bikes](data/product_catalog.json)
- Provide recommendations based on the customer's message.

### 3.3 Lead Generation
- When customer interest is confirmed, the agent must collect:

    - Customer name
    - Email address
    - Phone number

- Using this information, the agent creates a Lead in the CRM system via a API ```POST /ctream-crm/api/v1/leads```

**Request Payload**
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "+491234567"
}
```

### 3.4 Appointment Scheduling (OUT_OF_SCOPE)
- After lead creation, and the user confirms for an appointment, the agent should create an appointment.
- Appointment must be created via following API ``POST /ctream-crm/api/v1/appointments``

**Request**
```json
{
  "conversation_id": "XXX",
  "customer_id": "XXX"
}
```

### 3.5 FAQ
- In addition to the product catalog, the agent must also use unstructured text data from: [faq.txt](data/faq.txt)

## 4. Requirements & Evaluation

- **Language**: Python
- **API**: REST or WebSocket
- **Data**: Use only `/data/bike_shop.json`
- **AI**:
    - Visible **prompt engineering**
    - Apply **RAG** for product recommendations
